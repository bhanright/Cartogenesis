     * again at its review round, whose joins are relay ramps and whose valleys are Earth's width,
     * 55 km across: the plates' partition held and their
     * height, uplift and age moved with everything built on them. K1 re-took the erosion's and the
     * sea's, the terrain and the plates holding: the erosion is fed a provisional climate, whose
     * weather noise K1 made square on the ground, and the sea stage carries the ice's scour, which
     * K1 made square too. An ocean change that leaks into the ground moves them.
     * A chunk meant to move the ground re-takes them here, as the render records are re-taken.
     * At [SharedWorlds.DETAIL_ROWS], whose standard worlds the detail guards generate anyway, so
     * the pin costs a digest and no generation.
