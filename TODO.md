# To do

## Done

- **Lakes** (2026-08-23) — basins the flood had to raise are now standing water, with rivers
  running in and one leaving at the outlet. Took uphill-looking river segments from 13-20% down to
  12-14%; what is left is shallow filled ground below the lake depth threshold.
- **Ocean currents** (2026-08-23) — surface flow is solved for rather than drawn: wind stress has
  a curl, and the stream function satisfying that curl inside a closed basin *is* a gyre. Poleward
  flow arrives warm on 85% of samples and the anomaly reaches ±7°C, which is the right order for
  a western boundary current. Sea temperature feeds evaporation and coastal climate, two new map
  layers draw the currents and the wind belts, and coastal habitability now answers to both — warm
  water for the harbour, cold upwelling on a shelf for the fishery.
- **Geography audit** (2026-08-23) — see [GEOGRAPHY.md](GEOGRAPHY.md). Rules checked with
  `GeographyAuditTest` rather than assumed. Capital siting was the one clear violation and is
  fixed; the remaining deviations are recorded below.

## Open

- **Desert latitude.** Rain shadow can still overwhelm the latitude band and push desert toward the
  equator where rainforest belongs. The ITCZ curve was rewritten as three bells (ITCZ, subtropical
  high, storm track) during the ocean work, which fixed 60 degrees reading as the driest band and
  helped the spread, but the audit is still uneven: the share of desert falling in the 15-45 degree
  band is 97% and 75% on seeds 7 and 1234, and only 53% and 43% on seeds 42 and 99. The remaining
  cause looks like orographic strength rather than the bands themselves.
- **Tectonic drift.** Requested 2026-08-23 as a stretch goal and not started. Plates already carry
  a drift vector, but it only classifies boundaries — nothing moves. Simulating it would mean
  stepping plates across several frames and accumulating the terrain each step, so a range records
  where a boundary *was* as well as where it is, and a coastline can carry a rifted margin that
  matches another continent's.
- **Territory editing on the map.** `WorldOverrides.territory` is saved, applied and rendered, but
  there is no gesture to reassign a cell. Realm statistics also would not recompute after an edit.
- **8192 exports.** Untested. 4096 peaks at 2.0GB, so 8192 would want roughly 8GB — inside the
  12GB heap, but the FFT buffers may not be.
- **Landmark placement is single-threaded** at ~18% of generation time. Parallelising it means
  replacing the sequential RNG in its per-cell scoring with a position-derived hash, which would
  change which sites a given seed produces.
- **The chamfer distance transform leaves faint octagonal streaks** in terrain near plate
  boundaries. An exact Euclidean transform would remove them.
- **`WorldCodec.FORMAT_VERSION` is 2 but nothing reads it.** Fine until the format changes
  incompatibly, at which point a migration needs somewhere to hook in.
